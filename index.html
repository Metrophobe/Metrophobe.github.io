          <div id="awidget">
            <p> My father always told me:</p>
<p><i> 'give to the world.... and forget about the rest. It always falls into place by itself...'</i></p>
<p>And boy was he right! I will always cherish his words now that he is in heaven; till we meet again!</p>
<p>As an academic / researcher / leader in real life it is felt that now's the time to embark onto something bigger and more ambitious that will impact positively the world around us. My objective is to give back to the world what it has given to me in the past.  Mind you I am no robot :) I have my hobbies and interests as well; I love animals, travelling, cars, movies, music, having a laugh and most importantly the sea :) </p>
<p>For those who know me in person, I have provided hands-on lecturing in various technologies for the past 20 years to individuals from all walks of life and all ages. I have provided conferences, bootcamps and other events through universities . My MSc (Advanced Software Engineering) dissertation won the Alstom award in 2015 for 'outstanding performance in software development'. My areas of specialization include Computer Vision, Machine Learing, NLP and I always keep myself up to date.</p>
<p>My Github repo is getting a refresh (so out with the old and in with the new relevant things). I do not just want to share knowledge but I want to make this tough world a friendlier place to aspiring software developers. Programming is an art that if well mastered, it can make the unthinkable happen so why not help others reach this goal?</p>
<p>Nothing comes easy and unforunately I did have some turbulent times as well.  This was what led me to be quiet for some time until everything was in order once again. I did learn a lot from past expereinces but one fine day, I was walking down the street and saw the words 'never look back' written on a wall.  That phrase holds true to everyone's lives passing through hardships! Never look back and never regret moving on! Being adaptable is one of the key strenghts to personal success</p>
<p>I am currently working on a project to assist on greening for an NGO and have also worked on other projects from start to completion (some of which are bound by NDA). I have overlooked the whole process from design of the architecture all the way to the deployment phase. This is the motivation why, I am seeking your help as sponsors.</p>
<p>I wish to delve onto a project that aims at help people find work across the world. A portal that will allow employers to find their potential employees through the use of elaborate heuristics. It will be scalable and multi-platform. The proceeds from the fees acquired through this SaaS will go to charity and other organisations that would need our help and assistance. I really wish that this dream comes true and with your help it will materialize.</p>
